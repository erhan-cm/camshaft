## What's Included

**Hardware:**  
You will find all the necessary information to assembly this project for yourself. If you have the time and resources, then even you can build one! You will find:  
- Bill of Materials. Parametric and all. Want to have a longer track? Then you can figure it out with this.  
- Fusion 360 projectfile. How does is look from the inside? Have a look.  
- 3D-printed files in .STL and .STEP format.  
- Cool assembly manual.

**Electronics**  
Kicad to the rescue. You can find:  
- Kicad files (including the component libraries).
- Schematics.
- Gerbers.

**Firmware**  
Hardware is nice and all. But it won't work without firmware.  
And I would like nothing else to share the complete source code. Unfortunately I won't be doing that just yet. I am hoping to sell complete kits in order to supplement my income. If you are interested in purchasing a set and save the trouble of sourcing all the parts, (and ofcourse financially supporting the creator) then please have a look at my tindy store.  
Alternatively, you can still find the .bin file to flash to the microcontroller. Just no lookie behind the scenes.
